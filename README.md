### Stage 1: DC-DC Booster 
 
### Stage 2: Full H-bridge 
 
### Stage 3: Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
 
### Asembly: Prototyping on Arduino Uno Shield board 

 
### STIMULATOR PARAMETERS:
- Channel: 1 (can be expanded to more channels) <br/>
- Pulse Amplitude: 0-100 mA peak into 500 ohm load <br/>
- Compliance Voltage: ±50 V  (maximum) <br/>
- Pulse duration: 50 µs (can be reprogrammed) <br/>
- Interpulse Interval: 1 µs (can be reprogrammed) <br/>
- Waveform: Biphasic square wave  <br/>
- Stimulation Frequency: 20 Hz (can be reprogammed) <br/>
- Carrier Frequency: 10 kHz (can be reprogrammed) <br/>
- Power: 9 V battery (can be rechared) <br/>

### DISCLAIMER:
<P align="justify"> The design is offered as it is. Although it has been regorously tested with utmost care and to the best of my knowledge, I do not provide any warranty in any aspect.

### WARNING:
- The desing is inteded strickly for research and education purpose. 
- The stimulator is not approved for human or animal use without receving prior approval from a local ethics committee such as Institutional Review Board
- The stimulator can generate high voltage and under no circumstances it should be placed across the chest or close to the heart
- The stimulator should never be powered or charged from external adapter, USB or power source while being used or connected to the body.
